# Stroke-Prediction-Analysis-in-R

-- Worked on the Stroke Prediction data set using Statistical Learning and Prediction Analysis in R.

-- Did Exploratory Data Analysis and implemented Logistics Regression, optimized Random Forest using our custom nodesize and mtry values, and implemented adaptive gradient boosting on the data. Boosting gave us the maximum testing accuracy of 95%.
